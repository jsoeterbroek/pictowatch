"Care givers, parents and health care professionals of people with a "
"mental disability and/or an Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or previously"
" referred to as 'autism', often make use of visual pictograms to give "
"people a clearer understanding of the world around them."

"One of the biggest advantages of using pictograms (or pictos) is that in "
"one easy to grasp visual form the activities and their sequence that are "
"planned for the day ahead are presented. This provides understanding and "
"prevents stress and miscommunication."

"Often the pictos are presented on a board on the wall or simply on a "
"wooden plank on which the pictos are added (or even removed during the "
"day) showing the activities and the order in which these take place. "
"While this low tech way often works fine in practice it is not portable "
"and often only used in either the users' household or the (work) places "
"during the day."

"The pictostick offers a method to present a scrollable sequence of pictos"
" for the user in a portable way, either as a small device that can be "
"carried around or a watch-like option with a wrist band. The pictostick "
"can be referred to by the user as to the daily activities and even to "
"check off the ones that have already been completed."
